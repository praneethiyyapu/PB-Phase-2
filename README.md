# PB-Phase-2

•Collected streaming tweets using tweepy API and stored them in json format.
•Used Apache Spark to analyze collected tweets and developed interesting queries in Scala/SparkSQL on those tweets.
•Few of the queries include finding top followed unverified users, top tweeted languages other than English, top time-zones, the percentage of tweets which contain sensitive data, top places from which tweets are made, tweets made on a particular day and most popular hashtags.
•Have developed appropriate visualizations for the corresponding queries using HTML5, CSS3 and D3.js
